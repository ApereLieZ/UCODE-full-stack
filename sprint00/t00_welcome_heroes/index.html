        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. <b> So in order to be a superhero, you need a power
         that is more exceptional than any power a normal human</b> being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
         Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story 
         or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. <i>If the good guy
         is doing something that a normal human</i> being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <p>Batman</p>
    <p>A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life 
        affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect
         base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his 
         family’s sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, 
         dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy 
         streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.</p>
