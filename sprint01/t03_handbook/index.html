                Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] Its use for retrieving inter-linked resources led to the establishment of the World Wide Web.
                HTTP development was coordinated by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
                culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs), most notably RFC 2616 (June 1999), 
                which defines HTTP/1.1.

                The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify 
                computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. 
                The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly 
                used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the 
                underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other 
                functions as well. The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

                TCP/IP is two things – ” Transmission Control Protocol “, and ” Internet Protocol “, and between them, they 
                form the basic building material of the Internet.
                TCP/IP is a communications protocol that public networks like the Internet, as well as private intrane
                ts and extranets use. Any device that connects to the Internet, or which transmits and receives data uses TCP/IP protocol layers.
                The first part, the Transmission Control Protocol has the job of chopping up all the data that’s sent into discrete uni
                ts called packets. It is also responsible for sending and receiving them.
                The Internet Protocol layer acts like a courier. It’s responsible for addressing each packet and making sure that it get
                s to where it’s supposed to go. Every time a packet makes the hop to another computer along the way the address is checked again
                so that it eventually reaches it. The beauty of this approach is that you can divide a message into lots of packets and send them all away on diff
                erent routes, and they can still be put back together at the end to form the complete message.
